# Agentic-AI-Assistant-Retail-Customer-Support-Project
Developed an intelligent assistant for ShopUNow that leverages RAG and Agentic AI to route and answer queries. The system uses an LLM-driven classifier for sentiment and department routing across HR, IT, Orders, and Returns. It features a Chroma vector database for context-aware responses and an automated human escalation workflow.
